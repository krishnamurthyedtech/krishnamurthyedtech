    </div>

    <p>In today’s fast-paced digital era, <b>Cloud Computing</b> is not just an advantage — it’s a necessity. From
      small startups to global enterprises, every business depends on the cloud to store data, run applications,
      deliver services, and scale seamlessly.</p>

    <p>Gone are the days when companies relied on heavy servers and complex hardware setups. With platforms like
      <b>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</b>, <b>Microsoft Azure</b>, and <b>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</b>, organizations
      can now innovate faster, reduce costs, and operate globally — all with a few clicks.
    </p>

    <p>The cloud has redefined business efficiency, flexibility, and innovation. And behind this revolution are
      skilled <b>Cloud Engineers</b>, <b>DevOps Experts</b>, and <b>Solution Architects</b> — professionals who make
      it all possible.</p>

    <h4>💼 What Is Cloud Computing?</h4>
    <p>Cloud Computing simply means accessing computing services — like storage, databases, networking, and software —

      <li>💾 Store and manage unlimited data securely</li>
      <li>⚙️ Deploy and run applications anywhere, anytime</li>

      <li>🔄 Scale resources up or down based on need</li>
      <li>🌎 Enable remote collaboration and digital innovation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Whether it’s Netflix streaming millions of videos or a local e-commerce site managing transactions, cloud
      technology powers it all.</p>

    <h4>🚀 Why Cloud Computing Is the Future of IT Careers</h4>
    <p>As companies migrate to the cloud, the demand for skilled cloud professionals has skyrocketed. Roles like
      <b>Cloud Architect</b>, <b>Cloud Engineer</b>, <b>DevOps Specialist</b>, and <b>Site Reliability Engineer
        (SRE)</b> are among the most sought-after positions in tech today.
    </p>

    <p><b>Here’s why Cloud Computing is shaping the future:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>🌐 <b>Global Demand:</b> Every industry is adopting cloud technology — from healthcare to finance.</li>
      <li>💰 <b>High Salaries:</b> Cloud-certified professionals earn some of the best packages in IT.</li>
      <li>⚙️ <b>Endless Innovation:</b> Constant updates mean you’ll always work with cutting-edge tools.</li>
      <li>🧩 <b>Career Flexibility:</b> Opportunities across AWS, Azure, and GCP make you globally employable.</li>
      <li>🔒 <b>Job Security:</b> Cloud adoption is accelerating, not slowing down — ensuring long-term growth.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In short, the cloud is where the future of IT lives, and professionals with cloud expertise are leading that
      future.</p>

    <h1>The Role of DevOps in Building Modern Applications</h1>
  </section>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="text-center mb-5 mt-5">
      <h2>Speed. Reliability. Continuous Innovation.</h2>
    </div>

    <p>In today’s fast-moving digital landscape, businesses must deliver applications quickly, reliably, and
      continuously.
      Traditional software development often faces delays, frequent bugs, and miscommunication between teams —
      challenges that
      <b>DevOps</b> is specifically designed to solve.
    </p>

    <p>At <b>Krishnamurthy EdTech</b>, our <b>DevOps Training Program</b> equips learners with the skills, tools, and
      industry best practices
      needed to automate development workflows, enhance collaboration, and deliver high-quality software faster.
      You’ll gain hands-on experience with essential tools such as Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines,
      preparing you for
      modern IT environments where speed, quality, and scalability are critical.</p>

    <h4>What is DevOps?</h4>
    <p>DevOps, a blend of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops), is both a culture and a methodology aimed at
      improving collaboration,
      automation, and efficiency in software development.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Automation:</b> Reduce repetitive tasks like testing, deployment, and infrastructure setup</li>
      <li><b>Collaboration:</b> Bridge gaps between development, testing, and operations teams</li>
      <li><b>Continuous Improvement:</b> Monitor, test, and optimize applications continuously</li>
      <li><b>Scalability & Reliability:</b> Deliver software that scales seamlessly and performs consistently</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In simple terms, DevOps ensures that software development is faster, smoother, and more reliable, turning ideas
